Issifu.java solves task 1
Issifu2.java solves task 2

Make sure input files and .java files (Issifu.java and Issifu2.java) are in the same location
Make sure you can compile and run java programmes via command-line
When passing parameters, don't add extensions (use data1, don't use data1.csv)

In command-line, cd to where the files are located and perform the following.
for task 1:
	compile by: javac Issifu.java
	run by: java Issifu covid_data population_data
for task 2:
	compile by: javac Issifu2.java
	run by: java Issifu2 covid_data partial_time_series

Output files will be created in you your current directory.
Enjoy!
